#Q.1)Write a Python program to find the number of times 4 appears in the tuple.

# Define a tuple with some numbers
numbers = (1, 2, 4, 5, 4, 6, 7, 4, 8, 9, 4)

# Use the count() method to count the number of times 4 appears in the tuple
count_of_4 = numbers.count(4)

# Output the result
print(f"The Number 4 Appears {count_of_4} times in the tuple.")

"""
